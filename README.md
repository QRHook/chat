## QR Hook Chat Experiment

THis project is being utilized to allow me to engage in an appropriate
development process. Thus far it has helped me understand the process of
creating a module and how to form pieces of a project.

## Project Plan

The plan for this project is to enable secure peer to peer chat. In the short
term this will be done over socket.io over a server. In the long term this will
be faciliated by WebRTC for pure Peer to Peer chat.

## TODO:

- Setup forming of data for each chat message to be inserted into database
- Write the logic to properly place a new chat "group" together when a chat is
  initiated.
- Emulate the process of initiating a chat to establish the variables at hand.
